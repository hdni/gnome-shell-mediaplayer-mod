# Media player indicator mod
A fork of the fantastic [Media player indicator extension by eonpatapon](https://github.com/eonpatapon/gnome-shell-extensions-mediaplayer) for Gnome Shell 3.10.

## Features
* Removes the symbolic status icon before the song information in the panel;
* Removes the playing/paused/stopped icon after the song info in the panel;
* Removes the icon before the player name;
* Removes the repeat icon before the elapsed time;
* Tweaks the appearance of the close button to fix alignment of player name;
* Other color and padding tweaks to go with my Phosphene Shell theme.
